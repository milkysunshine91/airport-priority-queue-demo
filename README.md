airport-priority-queue-demo
=========

+ A simple priority queue demo. Special thanks to my friends Chau Nguyen for his contributions to this project.
+ There are 3 queues at the airport, one of them is used for VIP and VUP(Very UnImportant Person) who has no luggages. Processing time for those who does not carry luggages is faster, at about 4 seconds, while normally it would take 10 seconds instead.
